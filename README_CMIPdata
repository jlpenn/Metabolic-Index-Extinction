Notes on CMIP data downloading and processing 

This document describes how to download and process the CMIP archive data for inputs to the extinction model code. 
Briefly, the data is to be annually averaged (if not already when downloaded) and regridded to the WOA grid before an anomaly field is created by subtracting the pre-industrial time-mean fields (1850-1900) from each model year in the greenhouse gas forcing experiments (e.g., historical, rcp8.5, ssp5-8.5, etc.). 

Downloading the data
An OpenID from ESGF is required for the downloading.

Standard website for CMIP5:
https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip5/

Standard website for CMIP6:
https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/

Alternate website for CMIP6 at DKRZ:
https://esgf-data.dkrz.de/search/cmip6-dkrz/

Alternate website for CMIP6 at IPSL:
https://esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr/search/cmip6-ipsl/

In all web interfaces, select variables by categories, e.g., Source ID (= model), Experiment ID (= historical etc.), Frequency (annual, monthly etc.), and Variable (the shorthand name) or CF Standard Name (the long name of the variables). 
The Realm (e.g., ocean or ocnBgchem) can be selected first to show only the relevant variables for this realm. Click the Search button for successive updates. 
Every time this is done, the Variables list on the left will be updated and available files will be shown on the right.

If multiple variables or experiments are downloaded, it's best to add the files successively to the Data Cart, and finally go to the Data Cart and create the wget script.

For wget, use the "-s" option, e.g.:
bash $file -s            [for one wget script]
for file in wget*; do bash $file -s ; done       [for multiple scripts]


Storing the data on the server
The top level directory has subdirectories CMIP5 and CMIP6. In the following it will be referred to as $CMIP_ROOT.
Each of these has subdirectories for each experiment - their names must be exactly the same as the model names that are used within the file names, e.g. IPSL-CM6A-LR

Each model directory has subdirectories for the experiments (e.g., historical and rcp8.5 for CMIP5 or ssp585 for CMIP6).
Each of the experiment directories has a subdirectory called native_grid. All files on the native model grid should be stored in there, whereas all files on the WOA grid should be stored in the "main" directory for each model/experiment.

The wget script (which can contain files for different models and experiments) should be run in $CMIP_ROOT/CMIP6 or $CMIP_ROOT/CMIP5, respectively.

Script process_cmip_files.py is run in the same directory.

It will concatenate separate files (by time) for each model/experiment/variable combination into one and move all *.nc files in the current directory to the appropriate model/experiment/native_grid subdirectories. 
Directories will be created if necessary.
The -k option is useful in those cases where extended runs (to 2300) exist; you may want to keep the original files. 


Processing the data
Note: For all Python scripts described below, the nco operators must be installed in a standard path. Typically, this is done by installing the nco RPM.

Creation of annual means from monthly means

This requires averaging over 12 months at a time. (Note that for CMIP5 data from Hadley, files typically span December to November, not January to December. In most cases, I disregarded this and averaged from December to November.)
To achieve this with nco, one would have to run a loop over the years and run ncrcat for one year at a time.
Matlab function nc_rec_avg achieves the same goal with a single function call of the form
nc_rec_avg(fname_in, fname_out)

Note that this Matlab function (and many others) are built upon the old USGS netcdf toolbox, not the modern Matlab-internal netcdf functions.


Regridding to standard 1x1 degree WOA grid
This can be done with the cdo command.   [This must be downloaded directly from DKRZ and compiled on the local machine. There is no CentOS package for it.]
Regrid2WOA_cdo.pl is a wrapper script that sets the correct options for the cdo command, handles file renaming etc.
(Invoke it with option -h to see all options.)

The normal call is simply
Regrid2WOA_cdo.pl  <input_files>
